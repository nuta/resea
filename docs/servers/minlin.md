# MinLin - A binary compatibility layer for Linux programs (experimental)
MinLin is twofold: MinLin server and MinLin Linux distribution.

MinLin server is responsible for providing ABI compability
(especially Linux system calls) for *unmodified* Linux binaries
that run natively on Resea.

MinLin Linux is a minimalistic Linux distribution for testing
this compatibility layer. Of course it runs on Linux kernel as well.
